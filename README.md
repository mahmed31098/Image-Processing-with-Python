Image Processing with Python: Frequency Domain Filtering for Noise Reduction and Image Enhancement

Introduction

In contemporary times, image processing has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, spanning various domains such as social media and medical imaging. Notably, images acquired via digital cameras or other sources such as satellite photos and medical scans may necessitate pre-processing to eliminate or enhance noise. In this context, frequency domain filtering presents a viable solution by facilitating the elimination of noise while concurrently sharpening images.

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a mathematical technique utilized to transform images from their spatial domain to their frequency domain, is a pivotal tool for frequency transformation in image processing. By leveraging the frequency domain representation of an image, we can effectively analyze the image based on its frequency content, thus simplifying the application of filtering procedures to eliminate noise. The subsequent sections will discuss the various stages involved in the frequency transformation of images from FFT to inverse FFT, incorporating the use of FFT shift and inverse FFT shift.
